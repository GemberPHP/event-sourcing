## In a nutshell

#### Traditional 'Aggregate driven' EventSourcing

Domain concepts are modeled towards objects: the aggregate.

- Any business logic related to a single domain object should live inside the aggregate
- Logic that involves other domain objects or groups of the same kind of domain objects does not belong in the aggregate

#### 'Use case driven' EventSourcing
Domain concepts are modeled through use cases.

- Any business logic tied to a use case should live inside that use case
- A use case can relate to one or more domain concepts
